Exploratory-Data-AnalysisExploratory Data Analysis of Centers of disease control and prevention(CDC) and Twitter Flu and InFluenza Data.
I have also deployed the project as a R Shiny application.(https://yogesh-amit.shinyapps.io/dic_heatmap_deployment/)

The details of the Project are:

* Explored the real Flu data mined by Center for Disease Control(CDC) and replicated their analysis in the form on bar plots, line graph plots and heat maps in R programming language using RStudio IDE.

* Collected tweet data related to Flu and Influenza using Twitter REST API.

* Processed and cleaned the collected data using TwitteR vignette library package.

* Visualized geo spatial information extracted from the tweets using Google API and geo-map libraries of R: ggplot2, ggmap, maps,and maptools.

* Compared CDC flu map with own home-brewed flu map of the USA derived from the Twitter and Influenza data .
